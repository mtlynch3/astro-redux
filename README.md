GH Pages link: https://mtlynch3.github.io/astro-redux/

Note: nothing is displayed to the site due to mixed content error (the API endpoint is not secure). Mixed content error occurs when initial HTML (the gh pages site) is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection, but other resources (such as data from an API) are loaded over an insecure HTTP connection.

You can see the following error in the console:

Mixed Content: The page at 'https://mtlynch3.github.io/astro-redux/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

If you clone the repo and run it locally, the data will be displayed.
